Started this project to revisit and sharpen my Angular skills. I've been dedicating time to enhancing and updating the application incrementally. Currently, improving the user interface and developing the admin dashboard. Login functionality and user authentication are in the pipeline.

Feedback is always appreciated as I continue to evolve and refine this project. Feel free to share your insights. ðŸ™‚
